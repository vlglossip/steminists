        <h2>Challenges faced by Women in Math:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Educational barriers</li>
            <li>Lack of representation in leadership roles</li>
            <li>Salary disparities</li>
            <li>Unconcious bias in hiring and promoting</li>
            <li>Hostile work environments</li>

        <h2>Before the unfortunate COVID-19 pandemic, the number of female engineers was steadily growing, reaching a peak of 14%. However, in the wake of the pandemic,
            women in this field have suffered a great setback, bringing their numbers down to around 13%. Steps need to be taken to change this!</h2>

        <p>In the dynamic world of engineering, female engineers encounter a unique set of challenges that shape their professional journeys. From navigating 
            male-dominated work environments to confronting gender bias in project assignments and performance evaluations, women engineers often face uphill 
            battles in their quest for recognition and advancement. The scarcity of female role models and mentors further compounds these challenges, 
            leaving many women engineers to navigate the complexities of the field on their own. Despite these obstacles, female engineers continue to defy 
            stereotypes and push boundaries, contributing their innovative perspectives and technical expertise to tackle some of society's most pressing challenges. 
            As the engineering profession strives for greater diversity and inclusion, it is imperative that we address systemic barriers and create supportive 
            environments where women engineers can thrive and lead with confidence.</p>
        

        <h2> Overcoming these barriers is no easy task...however, there are many women who have overcome these challenges and risen to greatness!</h2>

        <h1> Let's celebrate these high-reaching modern female engineers</h2>
        <img id ="gwynne" src="gwynne.jpg" alt = "Gwynne Shotwell: COO of SpaceX">
        <p>Gwynne Shotwell is the COO and President of SpaceX. Under her leadership, SpaceX was the first private company to send a satellite into geostationary 
            orbit, too. Setting new standards is one of her favorite things about the job, with milestones like landing a first-stage booster on a drone ship and on
            land, re-flying a rocket, launching Falcon Heavy, the most powerful rocket currently in operation.</p>
