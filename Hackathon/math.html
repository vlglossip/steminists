        <h2>Challenges faced by Women in Math:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Societal stereotypes and bias</li>
            <li>Underrepresentation</li>
            <li>Unequal oppurtunities</li>
            <li>Unfair wages</li>
            <li>Work-life balance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Although the number of women in math is steadily increasing, it will take at least 30 years until there are equal numbers of men and women in this proffession</h3>
        
        <p>The mathematics community grapples with a pervasive gender gap, leading to the underrepresentation of women in tenured faculty positions.
            Additonally, women are less likely to recieve prestigious awards and leadership roles in the field. Women mathematicians often contend with systemic barriers,
            including implicit bias, stereotypes, and unequal oppurtunities for advancement and recognition Efforts to address these challenges and promote gender 
            equality in mathematics involve initiatives aimed at increasing access to quality education, providing mentorship and support networks, challenging stereotypes, 
            and advocating for policy changes within academia and beyond. Achieving true gender equality in mathematics requires sustained dedication and collaboration from 
            individuals, organizations, and policymakers to create inclusive and equitable environments where women mathematicians can thrive and contribute fully to the field."</p>

        <h3> Overcoming these barriers is no easy task...</h3>
        <h5>However, there are many women that have overcome these challenges and risen to greatness!</h5>

        <h2> Let's acknowledge incredible female mathematicians and their acheivements</h2>
